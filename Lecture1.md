## Before this course, you should install some tools in your computer.



#### How should I choose an Editor? It depend on your goal.

- ###### Have a try in an easy program language.

  You can download python3 in their offical website [https://www.python.org/downloads/].  It coverd all basic function, and enough to a experimenter.

  It's worth noting that whatever your goal is, I recommend you download Python3 IDLE, right. 

  

- ###### Study programing a little deeply.

  I suggest an IDE named Pycharm. The downlond website is [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/]. The community version is enough to you, you have no need to buy the perfessional edition.

- ###### Be a programmer, or try more program languages.

  maybe Visual studio community is a good choice[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/]. But remeber:After your download, you need to install Python in "VS installer".

  

#### Which note-tool is better?

- ###### there are many tools to make a note internet. My advise is **Typora** ---- a small editor for **markdown**.

  "Markdown" is an almost perfect file format whitch can write programing note. It can be copied directly to the blog! Now, maybe you know how I write this blog.

  

#### First using in Python.

- ##### There are two modes in using Python----interaction mode and file mode.

  - ###### Interaction mode

    This is Python Interaction mode`s enter Interface.

    You can do some easy things in here.

  - Run code which only have one line.
    For example:
    1.declare variates.
    2.Print variates or strings.
    3.do calculation.
    4.other things.

  - Print variate which be used in file mode.

    (What is variate, we will introduce it in the future.)

  Now, lets have a try.

   Isert this code  [ **print("Hello World!")** ]  in the enter interface.(without square brackets)

   Then you will find a string appeard on your screen.

   ###### file mode

  - write python progarm.

    1.First, please create a new file.
    2.insert your code in this window.
    3.[Run]->[Run Module]->[Yes]

    Please experiment by yourself with what happens.

- ######  Here is the simplest python program.

  (It can judged weather you install succesd.)

```python
	print("Hello World!")
```
